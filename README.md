# de-Moivre-number
Given n, find the n-th de Moivre number

In mathematics, a de Moivre number is any complex number that gives 1 when raised to some integer power n. Roots of unity are used in many branches of mathematics, and are especially important in number theory, the theory of group characters, and the discrete Fourier transform.

In field theory and ring theory the notion of de Moivre number also applies to any ring with a multiplicative identity element. Any algebraically closed field has exactly n nth roots of unity, if n is not divisible by the characteristic of the field.

An nth de Moivre number, where n is a positive integer (i.e. n = 1, 2, 3, …), is a number z satisfying the equation

$$
z^n = 1. 
$$

where z is a complex number. Generally, z ∈ R can be considered for any field R, or even for a unital ring. In this general formulation, an nth de Moivre number is just an element of the group of units of order n. Interesting cases are finite fields and modular arithmetics, for which the article de Moivre number modulo n contains some information.

An nth de Moivre number is primitive if it is not a kth de Moivre number for some smaller k:

$$
z^k \ne 1 \qquad (k = 1, 2, 3, \dots, n-1  ). 
$$
